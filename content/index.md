I'm Sibyl from China. Now I live in Shenzhen, a city full of innovation and tolerance in the far south of China. I hope to have more in-depth communicate with people, you, to understand the bigger and more beautiful world, differ from cultures and regions.Starting from myself, I create my digital garden here and actively connect with the world and you.

I’m Portuguese and live in Lisbon, Portugal, with my wife and daughter. I work as a product designer in tech, and I identify myself as a creative person. I love arts, designing, sketching and experimenting with expressing feelings, experiences, stories, beliefs, ideas and contributing with useful messages, solutions and inspiration to society.

Here in this [digital garden](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/note/digital_garden), I mostly write for myself, exercise cognition, and take notes that may come in handy to generate new ideas. They’re for anyone, including me, to pick up, digest, and create.

I mostly write notes about:

- [#design](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/tags/design) practice and inspirations,
- occasionally some drawing in the[#sketchbook](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/tags/sketchbook),
- [#music](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/tags/music) I find out there to listen,
    - a lot of[#experimental_music](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/tags/experimental_music),
    - and I also collect[#cover_art](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/tags/cover_art) that I love,
- things I[#bookmark](https://www.pmcf.xyz/topo-da-mente/tags/bookmark) from the web,
- and more topics!

I believe in shared information and e-societies. I think we’re heading toward communal knowledge, and it’s important to be free of ownership, capitalization of ideas and propagate innovation that benefits society.

This garden is called “Topo da mente” because it’s Portuguese for “Top of mind”, in a direct translation, but we don’t use it as an idiomatic expression.
