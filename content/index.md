I'm Sibyl from China. Now I live in Shenzhen, a city full of innovation and tolerance in the far south of China. I think I am a person with a wide range of interests, such as literature, art, CG illustrations, computers, data-related, etc., and I like to try new and interesting things. I will also pay attention to developments in business and management, which are relevant to my work.

In addition, I often spend a lot of time immersed in my own thinking space without realizing it. Sometimes I can catch these thoughts, but most of them slip away. I hope to try my best to record some valuable thoughts and take notes for new ideas. they are for everyone, including me, to pick up, create, and share. 

This digital garden is mostly about:


- [S'Note](https://sibylyang55.github.io/S'Note/): Share knowledge and skills that have a great impact on my personal development, such as theories, and models...
- [S'Blog](https://sibylyang55.github.io/S'Blog/): Record thoughts, essays, comments, poems, insights, inspirations...
- [S'Life](https://sibylyang55.github.io/S'Life/): Share hobbies, travel, and happy-meaningful things in life...

I hope to have more in-depth communication with people, like you, to understand the bigger and more beautiful world, different from cultures and regions. Starting from myself, I create my digital garden here and actively connect with the world and you.
